# Data Structures & Algorithms in C++

My goal for this repository is to master all of the essential concepts of Data Structures and Algorithms. Not only
to help me ace the coding interview, but to also keep my skills sharp. <br>

Each directory will focus on a specific topic and will include an ever growing number of problems and solutions,
along with notes on the respective subject.<br>


## Topics Covered:
### Data Structures
* Linked Lists
* Trees, Tries, and Graphs
* Stacks and Queues
* Heaps
* Vectors / ArrayLists
* Hash Tables

### Algorithms
* Breadth-First Search
* Depth-First Search
* Binary Search
* Merge Sort
* Quick Sort

### Other Concepts
* Bit Manipulation
* Memory (Stack vs Heap)
* Recursion
* Dynamic Programming
* Big O (Time and Space Complexity)
